The shower is a loving and supportive gathering of women and children ready to embrace this woman in her time of mourning yet courageous act of love. We shower her with pampering feel-good gifts as well as spiritual keepsakes and encouraging letters.\", \"history\": \"Here&#39;s a little story: a long time ago I, Michele Hansen, found myself in a crisis pregnancy with little to no support. The father wanted an abortion and the father&#39;s mother was thrown a &quot;Grandma Shower&quot; by her friends. I was invited to attend the shower but it was not for me as I soon realized. When I walked through the door I immediately became aware that I was being shunned for my unwed pregnancy. Not one woman congratulated me, gave me a hug of encouragement, or even smiled at me during the grandma shower. As I sat in a chair in the corner, the grandma was at the center circled by her friends, opening all of the cute baby gifts and showing them off, gifts that would go to her house. I felt embarrassed and my stomach churned as I tried to be cheerful during the shower. As we were leaving someone said, &quot;here&quot; and handed me a gift card to Babies R&#39; Us. I was thankful for that but will never forget the terrible feeling I left with that day. It was then that God has planted a seed in my heart to help moms in crisis pregnancies someday. Not knowing when or how it would happen but just knowing that it would. After becoming Catholic and having my son baptized, I was married and we now have ten children with number 11 on the way! I&#39;ve learned a lot about babies and the needs of a mother. Having a baby shower is truly a special day in a mother&#39;s life. It is an expression of love that is tangibly felt in the heart of the mother and all of the women supporting her. Many of these mothers have never felt that kind of love for them, the love of Christ and His Mercy. At a Little Flower Showers baby shower, moms who are desperately seeking encouragement for their decision to choose life are given the hugs they need, the smiles they want, and the gifts to show off for their babies. God also plants a seed in their hearts when He seems so distant to them. That is why I started Little Flower Showers with my friend Angie Robbins in April of 2016.
